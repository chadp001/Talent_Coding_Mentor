So, when you use the "say_the_number" function, it doesn't matter how big or small the number is that you give it. The function will use the same amount of space in your computer's memory to store the information it needs to do its job.

The function has a list of words for the numbers up to 20 and multiples of 10 up to 90, and it also knows how to add things like "thousand" or "million" to the end of a number. When you give it a number, it splits it into groups of three digits and works on each group one by one. As it goes, it stores some information in a list, but this information doesn't take up much space.

Finally, when it's done working on all the groups of digits, it puts all the information together into one big string and returns it.

So, because the function doesn't use more space in memory as the number gets bigger, the worst-case space complexity of say_the_number function is O(1). This means that no matter how big the number is, the function will always use about the same amount of space.
